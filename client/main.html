  <h1 class="intro" title="At least I'm pretty sure I am...">Hey, I'm Daniel. ;)</h1>
  <h2>I create products & companies.</h2>
  <p>
    I'm well versed in many skills around technology & product development. I like to build things â€“ usually with technology, with a side of grit. I've worn many hats in my career between executive positions, back-end dev, front-end dev, and product design. I love knowledge, and I strongly believe technology can, and should enrich every single life this universe has to offer.

    <p>This is the first time I am writing a LinkedIn recommendation for someone voluntarily - and Daniel truly deserves it. Daniel took over the project at a very critical time. Within 3 months of the project, the team rallied around him and rewrote and delivered the entire real-time messaging platform (API, data model, web front-end, and hybrid mobile apps) under tremendous constraints. Daniel simplified the engineering processes, works extremely well with the entire team, pays great attention to details, and always follow up/through. Best part is that he's multidisciplinary. Apart from being a great product manager, he understands UX/UI and is an excellent hands-on coder. Daniel is grace under pressure and I will work with him again anytime.</p>

    <p>Daniel is one of those extremely rare individuals who can both design and code with equal fluency. As a user interface and user experience desiger and implementer, he really does speak the 'native language of the web' with impressive chops in HTML/CSS using HAML and SASS, and JavaScript. His Ruby on Rails knowledge is impressive, and his ability to command jQuery is incredibly useful for a UI developer who is also a skilled designer.</p>
